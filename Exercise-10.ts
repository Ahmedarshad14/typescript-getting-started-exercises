// Q. Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point,
// just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.


/* 

The following program shows the favorite number of the user.

*/
//First we declare a variable 
const favNumber = 8;
//Console log the number with string.
console.log(`${favNumber} is my favorite number.`);

/* The following program shows number 8 

as result of different arithmatic operations.  

*/

//console log a string that shows how to add comments in TypeScript.

console.log(`The way to add comments is to add // for single line comments and for multiline comments, use /* ..... */`);
